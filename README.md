# GitGud Memory Game

A memory card game built with React, styled using Tailwind CSS, and powered by the Giphy API. This project was created as part of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) React curriculum to practice hooks, state management, and API integration.

## How It Works

Click on GIF cards to earn points—but don’t click the same one twice! Each correct click increases your score and reshuffles the cards. If you click a duplicate, your score resets. Your best score is saved locally so you can keep improving.
